The catalog intends to provide a visualization of the data set compiled in a MLR.
Treating the catalog as an open-source project enables any community member to submit a contribution as a pull request and help improve the catalog.
We did not extract the technology to which the test smell was initially proposed. Therefore, the catalog does not include such information, except for the code example when355
available.

The smells are presented grouped by Groups and Subgroups, listed by Garousi *et al.*

Every smell listed here contains at least one definition and one reference, and a code example, likely extracted from the reference listed.
