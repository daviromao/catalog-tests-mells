The catalog provides a visualization of the data set compiled in a Multivocal Literature Review published here. Initially, it unifies 127 formal and informal sources (sites, personal blogs, even videos!). As the catalog is open-source, any community member can submit a contribution as a pull request and help improve it.

Every smell listed here contains at least a definition, reference, and code example, likely extracted from the listed bibliography, which provides much more information. We expect the catalog to be a helpful resource for software testing community members to understand better the test smells. In this sense, it may help avoid adding new names to existing test smells in an overlap.


   Please help us keep this Catalog updated and **contribute with your own test smell findings**.

   Send in your helpful comments or ideas to easy@ic.ufal.br
   or contribute directly by clicking `Edit on GitHub` in the top right corner of any page on the catalog.

   If you are not familiar with directly editing, give us a new issue! `Click here and create a new  GitHub issue <https://github.com/easy-software-ufal/catalog-test-smells/issues/new?assignees=mantertius%2C+eas5&labels=enhancement&template=add-new-test-smell.md&title=%5BNEW%5D+Add+a+new+smell>`_
