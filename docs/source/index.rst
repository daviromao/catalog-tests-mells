Welcome to the Open Test Smell Catalog!
===================================

Search for your smell using the search or the sidebar if you already know where to look, or browse by category in the left panel. There is a lot to see!

The catalog provides a visualization of the data set compiled in a Multivocal Literature Review published here. Initially, it unifies 127 formal and informal sources (sites, personal blogs, even videos!). As the catalog is open-source, any community member can submit a contribution as a pull request and help improve it.

Every smell listed here contains at least a definition, reference, and code example, likely extracted from the listed bibliography, which provides much more information. We expect the catalog to be a helpful resource for software testing community members to understand better the test smells. In this sense, it may help avoid adding new names to existing test smells in an overlap.
