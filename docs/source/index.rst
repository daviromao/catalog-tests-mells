Welcome to the Open Test Smell Catalog!
===================================

Search for your smell using the **search** or the **sidebar**, if you already have an idea of where to look!

The catalog intends to provide a visualization of the data set compiled in a Multivocal Literature Review.
Treating the catalog as an open-source project enables any community member to submit a contribution as a pull request and help improve the catalog.
We did not extract the technology to which the test smell was initially proposed. Therefore, the catalog does not include such information, except for the code example when available.

The smells are presented grouped by Groups and Subgroups, with this segmentation proposed by Garousi *et al.*

Every smell listed here contains at least one definition, one reference, and a code example, likely extracted from the reference listed.

The catalog provides a helpful resource for software testing community members to better understand the test smells phenomena and helps avoid adding new names to existing test smells in an overlap.
