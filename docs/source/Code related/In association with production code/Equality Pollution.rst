Equality Pollution
^^^^^
Definition:

* The code that is put into production contains logic that should be exercised only during testsâ€¦ A system that behaves one way in the test lab and an entirely different way in production is a recipe for disaster!


Code Example:

.. code-block:: java

  /// <summary>
  /// Verifies that two objects are equal, using a default comparer.
  /// </summary>
  /// <typeparam name="T">The type of the objects to be compared</typeparam>
  /// <param name="expected">The expected value</param>
  /// <param name="actual">The value to be compared against</param>
  /// <exception cref="EqualException">Thrown when the objects are not equal</exception>
  public static void Equal<T>(T expected, T actual)
  {
      Equal(expected, actual, GetEqualityComparer<T>());
  }
