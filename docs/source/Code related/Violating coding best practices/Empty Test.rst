Empty Test
^^^^^
Definitions:

* Occurs when a test method has no executable statements. Such methods are possibly created for debugging purposes without being deleted or contain commented-out test statements. An empty test method can be considered problematic and more dangerous than not having a test case at all since JUnit will indicate that the test passes even if there are no executable statements present in the method body. As such, developers introducing behavior-breaking changes into production class, will not be notified of the alternated outcomes as JUnit will report the test as passing.
