Complex Assertions
^^^^^
Definitions:

* The assertions in a test require many lines of code to implement. At first blush, since test-scoped logic is typically itself untested, this can be risky. Additionally, multi-line assertions are typically harder to readâ€”both in terms of what they're doing and what they intend to say about the subject's behavior.
