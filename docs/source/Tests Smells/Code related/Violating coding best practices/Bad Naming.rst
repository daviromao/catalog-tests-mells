Bad Naming
^^^^^
Definitions:

* An identifier does not conform to a given naming convention. Before this smell can be detected, the naming conventions have to be agreed on. Proposed naming conventions for TTCN-3 can be found on the official TTCN-3 home page.
* When a test fails, or when the test base requires maintenance, the test names are the first thing developers will generally attempt to understand before they apply changes to the test or the code being tested. If test names are poor quality, developers will need to spend time reading the code and determining how the testâ€™s actual behavior is related to its name
