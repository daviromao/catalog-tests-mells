Obscure Test
^^^^^
Definitions:

* It is difficult to understand the test at a glance. Automated tests should serve at least two purposes. First, they should act as documentation of how the system under test (SUT) should behave; we call this Tests as Documentation (see Goals of Test Automation on page X). Second, they should be a self-verifying executable specification. These two goals are often contradictory because the level of detailed needed for tests to be executable may make the test so verbose as to be difficult to understand.
* A test that has a lot of noise in it, noise thatâ€™s making it hard to discern what the test is actually doing.

Also Known As:

* Long Test, Complex Test, Verbose Test
