General Fixture
^^^^^
Definition:

* Occurs when a test case fixture is too general and the test methods only access part of it. A test setup/fixture method that initializes fields that are not accessed by test methods indicates that the fixture is too generalized. A drawback of it being too general is that unnecessary work is being done when a test method is run.


Code Example:

.. code-block:: java

  public void testGetFlightsByFromAirport_OneOutboundFlight() throws Exception {
        setupStandardAirportsAndFlights();
        FlightDto outboundFlight = findOneOutboundFlight();
        // Exercise System
        List flightsAtOrigin = facade.getFlightsByOriginAirport(
                      outboundFlight.getOriginAirportId());
        // Verify Outcome
        assertOnly1FlightInDtoList( "Flights at origin", outboundFlight,
                                    flightsAtOrigin);
    }
    
    public void testGetFlightsByFromAirport_TwoOutboundFlights() throws Exception {
        setupStandardAirportsAndFlights();
        FlightDto[] outboundFlights = findTwoOutboundFlightsFromOneAirport();
        // Exercise System
        List flightsAtOrigin = facade.getFlightsByOriginAirport(
                      outboundFlights[0].getOriginAirportId());
        // Verify Outcome
        assertExactly2FlightsInDtoList( "Flights at origin", outboundFlights,
                                        flightsAtOrigin);
    }
  }
